              <p class="paragraph" style="font-size:2vw;"> <i> "Any sufficently advanced technology is indistingushible from magic" -- Arthur C. Clarke</i></p>
              <p class="paragraph" style="font-size:2vw;"> Perhaps the most infamous of Clarke's three laws, i've always been fascinated by the rapid
                growth of technolgical advancements. As a third year studying economics and computer science related fields, i've had the
                privilege of experiencing this firsthand.
                Growing up alongside the internet has shown me
                the amazing oppurtunites and radical changes emerging technologies can effect on the world.
                This technology and vision seem almost to be a part of Clark's described "magic", but if it weren't for such visionaries as Annie Easley and Elon Musk
                they would have remained in the realm of the intangible.
                Through role models such as these, i've cultivated a passion for technology and hope to help facilitate a better world alongside its impressive development. </p>

              <p class="paragraph"> This website was a fun side project that's pushed me to expand my programming skills, having fueled my passion
                for computers and further enriched my studies. </p>

              <p class="paragraph" > Thank you for visiting, and feel free to check out my other tabs about my work. </p>
